##### Object
> A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.  

##### Class
> Basically, a class combines the fields and methods(member function which defines actions) into a single unit.

##### Functions
> In C# a function is defined as a technique of wrapping code to perform a certain task and then return a value. 
> The basic difference between Methods and Functions is that the method comes with a void as return type whereas function has a return type.

##### Encapsulation
> Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.
> It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.
> In a different way, encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.
> Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of own class in which they are declared.
