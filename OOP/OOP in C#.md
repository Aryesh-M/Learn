> **TR:** A PIE (ðŸ¥§) - Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation   

#### Abstraction:   
> - A mechanism to provide the details about essential features without describing the background details  
> - For example, when you login into a website, you enter your UserId and password which is the essential information for login.   
> - Here you don't know about the background details like what happens with your userId and password, how it gets verified. All is abstrastracted from you.   

#### Encapsulation:   
> - A mechanism of binding the object state (fields) and behaviour (methods) together into a single unit.  
> - The encapsulation is mainly achieved by creating classes.     
> - The class is a kind of a container or capsule, which encapsulates the set of fields and methods.   

#### Inheritance:   
> - A mechanism of acquiring the features and behaviours of a class by another class.   
> - The class whose members are inherited is called the **base class**, and the class that inherits those members is called the  **derived class**.   

#### Polymorphism:   
> - Ability of an object to behave in multiple ways.     
> - For example, smart phone is a single object but it can be used for making calls, listening music, sending emails, taking pictures, etc.,

#### Class:   
> - A user defined data structure that contains data members (like fields, properties) and member functions (like methods, constructor, destructor)  
> - It is a  reference type and it acts as a template (blue print) for an object.   

#### Object:   
> - A representative of the class and allocates memory to its class members (fields)   
> - An object is a real world entity having attributes (fields) and behaviours (methods)   

#### Access Modifiers:  
> - Used to specify the accessibility of a member (field, method) or a type (class, interface)  
> - Support abstraction by exposing only necessary members and hiding other members

> 
> **Default constructor:**   
> - The default constructor has no parameters.   
> - When a class has no constructor, default constructor is served by the compiler to that class.   
> - Used to assign default values to instance variables of class.
