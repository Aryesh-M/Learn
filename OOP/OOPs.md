### OOP Fundamentals   
##### What is Object-Oriented Programming?  
> The followings are overall steps to develop an object-oriented application:   
> **1. Abstraction:** 
> - The process of exposing the essential data of an object to the outside of the world and hiding the low level data of that object is called as data abstraction. 
> - This principle of data hiding helps the programmer to build secure programs that do not disturb the code in other parts of program.
> 
> **2. Encapsulation:**  
> - The process of binding data and behaviour i.e. functionality of an object within a secured and controlled environment is called as encapsulation.
> - It keeps the data safe from the outside world.
> - This encapsulation principle is used to implement the information hiding i.e., data abstraction.
> 
> **3. Inheritance:** 
> - The process of acquiring the existing functionality of the parent and with new added feature and functionality by a child oject is called inheritance.
> - The advantages of inheritance are Generalization, Extensibility, and Reusabiltiy.
> 
> **4. Polymorphism:**
> - An object in different forms and in each form it exhibits the same functionality but implemented in different ways.


> **Object Oriented Application:**
> - It's a collection of **related** objects, **communicating** with each other, exchanging **messages** with each other in a **controlled** environment as per the **rules** of the busines.
